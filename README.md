# MORE-Stress: Model Order Reduction based Efficient Numerical Algorithm for Thermal Stress Simulation of TSV Arrays in 2.5D/3D IC
## Overview
This repo contains the implementation of **MORE-Stress**, a novel numerical algorithm
for efficient thermal stress simulation of TSV arrays in 2.5D/3D ICs based on model
order reduction. The detailed methodology is described in the paper.
## Requirements
```
conda env create -f env.yaml 
```
Our algorithm is built upon the **FeniCS** framework. For more information, please refer to the project's [homepage](https://fenicsproject.org/).
## Usage
```
python main.py config.yml
```
